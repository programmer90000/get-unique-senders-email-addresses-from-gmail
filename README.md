This file allows you to use an `mbox` file to extract unique email addresses. The file name used can be adjusted by changing the `mbox_file` variable. The Python file can be run by running `python extract_senders.py` in the terminal. This will create a new file in the same directory titled `unique_senders.txt`. This file will contain each unique email address from the `mbox` file.
